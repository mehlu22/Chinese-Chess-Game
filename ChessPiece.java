/* This class allows us to create types of chesspieces. 
 * The methods and instances of the class allow to store and return the label, icon, row and column to move to, side to which piece belongs and chessboard.
 * Some methods towards the end of the class also allow to check if a piece is allowed to move to an indicated position either if that position is empty or to make a kill of the opposite piece
 * A method called moveDone() handles the processing once the move is completed*/
